This script automates the export of high-resolution georeferenced maps for each feature in a shapefile. It adjusts the layer's appearance, sets the map extent based on feature geometry, and exports the images while ensuring they are properly georeferenced using GDAL. The output is a series of TIFF files stored in a specified folder.
